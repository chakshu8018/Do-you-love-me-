# Do-you-love-me-
The "Do You Love Me?" Python project is a fun, interactive program where the computer simulates a conversation with the user, ultimately answering the question only in the 'YES' form, "Do you love me?" The project typically involves creating a simple script that uses conditional statements to provide different responses based on the user's input.
